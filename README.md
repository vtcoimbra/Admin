 Admin Dashboard with Reactjs
# Commands for run in linux:
 - 'npm install' to install all dependencies to run this project;
 - 'npm start' to run this project.

- OBS: I tried to join the login and dashboard screens, but something was preventing the initial screen from being the login screen, so I kept the folders separate
